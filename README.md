### Links

- GitHub Repo : (https://github.com/LabrousseDev/QR-Code)
- Live Site : (https://qr-code-blush.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML5 syntax
- Flexbox CSS
- Wave Generator Site (https://getwaves.io/)
- Vercel to launch the site

### What I learned

I learned how to use Flexbox and sizing an image and text to make thme fit in a div.
I also learned how to include a background image and how to position it nicely.
I did my first production site launching with Vercel and this was a very good moment beacuse I found it very intuitive and easy.


### Continued development
I still feel the need to do some more projects where I can implement Flexbox and train my CSS techniques. I am not completly confident in them right now.

### Useful resources

- MDN for CSS properties and values
